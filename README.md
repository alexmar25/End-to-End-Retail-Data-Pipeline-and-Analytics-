# End-to-End-Retail-Data-Pipeline-and-Analytics-


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an **end-to-end data pipeline** for a fictional retail company, showcasing how to process, clean, transform, store, and analyze sales data to derive actionable insights. The project combines **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Tableau** to handle the entire data lifecycle, from raw data ingestion to final business intelligence reporting.

---

## Objectives
- Build a robust data pipeline to process sales data.
- Design and populate a relational database schema (fact and dimension tables).
- Automate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using Python.
- Perform analysis and generate visualizations to uncover trends.
- Present insights using Tableau dashboards and Python Matplotlib plots.

---

## Workflow
### 1. **Data Pipeline (ETL Process)**:
#### **Extract**:
- The raw dataset was provided in CSV format.
- Data was loaded into **Python** for preprocessing and cleaning.

#### **Transform**:
- Cleaned column names, handled missing values, and converted data types.
- Split data into **fact** and **dimension** tables:
  - `dim_date` (Year, Month, Day, Quarter)
  - `dim_vehicle` (VIN, Brand, Model, Series, Bodystyle)
  - `dim_region` (Region, Country of Sale)
  - `sales_fact` (Sales Date, Revenue, Sales Volume, etc.)

#### **Load**:
- The cleaned and structured data was loaded into **PostgreSQL** using `SQLAlchemy`.

---

### 2. **Database Schema Design**
#### Tables:
- **dim_date**: Contains temporal information.
- **dim_vehicle**: Stores vehicle-related details.
- **dim_region**: Holds geographic data.
- **sales_fact**: Fact table with measures such as revenue and sales volume.

#### Example SQL Script:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dim_date (
    year_sold INT,
    month_sold INT,
    day_sold INT,
    quarter VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE dim_vehicle (
    vin_ VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    brand VARCHAR,
    model VARCHAR,
    series VARCHAR,
    bodystyle VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE dim_region (
    region VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    country_of_sale VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE sales_fact (
    vin_ VARCHAR,
    sales_date TIMESTAMP,
    sales_volume NUMERIC,
    gross_sales NUMERIC,
    net_sales NUMERIC,
    net_revenue NUMERIC,
    contribution_margin NUMERIC,
    FOREIGN KEY (vin_) REFERENCES dim_vehicle(vin_)
);
